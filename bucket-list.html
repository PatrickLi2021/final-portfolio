            </div>
            <br>
            <p>The goal of this project was to understand and apply different statistical tests used in design analysis to evaluate the impact of design changes on user interaction. By conducting A/B testing, I aimed to identify which design choices led
                to improvements in user experience and engagement on a web page. This project is crucial for designers and developers to make informed decisions and create interfaces that effectively meet user needs.</p>

                <h2>Research:</h2>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>The research involved understanding the principles of A/B testing and statistical analysis to evaluate the effects of design changes on user interaction. The audience includes designers, developers, and product managers who are interested
                in optimizing user experience and engagement on digital platforms. They seek insights into how design choices impact user behavior and how to improve usability and efficiency.</p>

            <h3>Data Collection</h3>
            <p>I was provided with a simple webpage, MedX, and tasked with scheduling an appointment, then I made UI changes to improve interaction. Changes included darkening button colors, adding spacing between appointment slots, and organizing appointments
                chronologically.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <p>I created null and alternative hypotheses for misclick rate, time on page, and time to first click. Hypotheses were based on expected improvements in user interaction due to design changes.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Predictions about Rejecting the Null Hypothesis</h3>
            <p>Predicted rejection of null hypotheses based on observed differences between versions A and B. Anticipated improvements in misclick rate, time on page, and time to first click for the modified website.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Statistical Tests</h3>
            <p>Conducted chi-squared test for misclick rate and one-tailed t-tests for time on page and time to first click. Analyzed key metrics including degrees of freedom, t-scores, and p-values</p>

                Reduced average time on page by approximately 68%, indicating increased efficiency and user engagement. Time to First Click: Original Website: 12,217.43 milliseconds Modified Website: 4,803 milliseconds Reduced average time to first click
                by approximately 61%, indicating enhanced user engagement and usability.</p>

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>A/B testing is a powerful method for evaluating design changes and improving user experience. Statistical tests like chi-squared and t-tests provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of design choices. Design decisions should be informed
                by data and user behavior to optimize usability and engagement.</p>
