            </div>
            <br>
            <p>This project was the final project of a full stack development course centered around hypertext/hypermedia systems. Throughout the course, I built out various features of a modern hypertext system, including nodes, anchors, links, and editable
                nodes (in this case, we defined a node as a distinct piece of information within the hypertext system, which could be a document, a page, an image, a video, an audio clip, or any other type of media or resource).</p>
            <br>

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>For this project, I worked in a group of 3 to construct a new travel planner/bucket list application that incorporated destination and route nodes, all situated within a global map view. Within the map, users would be able to place pins on
                various locations around the world and make routes between different destinations. Lastly, we would supply many other features for the map/node hypertext system, such as pinning locations, deleting destinations, etc. The problem that this
                application was intended to solve was to give users of our hypertext system a way to plan trips and vacations visually while also providing them with traditional annotation features to make notes about different destinations.

                <h2>Research:</h2>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>The target audience for this application woudl be any person who wants to organize a bucket list of destinations and plan trips to these destinations. For example, a Brown student could make a bucket list of destinations in Providence. They
                could add destinations to their list/map whenever they think of a new place to visit, check off places they've visited, organize their nodes into a Thanksgiving break or spring break travel plan by linking the nodes to form routes, filter
                locations on their bucket list by city to brainstorm a weekend trip to New York/Boston, or be alerted that they are near a restaurant on their bucket list while walking around Providence. This is similar to the Wanderlog travel planner.</p>
            <br>
            <div class="wanderlog-container">
                <img src="assets/wanderlog.png" alt="wanderlog">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>Another user case would be a group of friends who want to create a collaborative bucket list. In this case, each member of the group could add destinations, modify notes about the destinations, check off visited destinations, and create/modify/delete
                trails.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Before we started the project, we first planned out how we would build the application. We started out with a plain hypertext system that only featured anchors, links, and editable nodes. A picture of the front page of this system is shown
                below:
            </p>
            <br>
            <div class="initial-hypermedia">
                <img src="assets/initial_hypermedia.png" alt="initial hypermedia system">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>The front page of our application featured 2 different views of our nodes: <b>tree view</b> and <b>grid view</b>. The first step we wanted to complete was to add a global map feature that would contain all of the nodes/destinations. Because
                the frontend of this application was built in React, we first had to decide which library we wanted to use to display the map. We ultimately decided to use <em><b>React Leaflet</b></em>, which is a library that makes creating interactive
                maps easier. We chose this library over others such as Mapbox because it provided more features such as adding markers, displaying lines between nodes, and facilitating user interactions such as panning.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>In terms of the features themselves, we decided that the application would allow the user to pin their node (destination) to a central map and link an editable note to a specific destination that is pinned. The user can also highlight the
                node as visited or unvisited. <br><br> To help the user organize their nodes, we decided to add a priority for each node with 3 levels: <em>low, medium,</em> and <em>high</em>. This would be useful in the case where the user has several
                destinations and cannot visit all of them. The tool will then be able to create a route between pinned destinations for the user to plan out their trip. <br><br> As the user is planning and making changes to their trip, they should be
                able to delete nodes, which should update the route. Additionally, when the user deletes the route, the nodes themselves should not be changed. To help keep them organized, there will be a filter feature to search pinned destinations by
                visited status and priority.
            </p>

            <br>
            <div class="process-container">
                <div class="colored-square"></div>
                <h2>Process</h2>
            </div>
            <br>
            <h3>Backend</h3>
            <br>
            <p>In terms of backend functionality, our idea was to find a way to store each route in the database since that was one of the new node types that we wanted to add to our project. To do this, we would want to develop a function to make queries
                to the database in order to store this information.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Frontend</h3>
            <br>
            <p>In order to incorporate geographic nodes, we created a central map via React-Leaflet, which enables markers with their position to be pinned on the map and for informational pop-ups to appear when clicking on a marker. Instead of plain text
                pop-ups, we made the pop-up a link to an editable note about the location.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Routes will be saved in the backend through a data structure that keeps track of node order. We decided to create an interface called <b>IRoute</b> to store this data structure on the frontend. Extra fields like the type of destination or
                whether it has been visited were stored in the Node data structure in our backend.</p>
            <br>
            <div class="iroute-container">
                <img src="assets/iroute.png" alt="iroute code">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>For filtering, we created a feature that allows you to select the priority, type, region, etc. This involved fetching all the nodes from the backend and returning the ones with fields that match the filters. Each of these nodes adhered to
                the <b>IDestination</b> interface, which is shown below:</p>
            <br>
            <div class="idestination-container">
                <img src="assets/idestination.png" alt="idestination code">
            </div>
            <br>
            <h3>My Role</h3>
            <br>
            <p>My role in this project was to work on the frontend to get the central map to be displayed for the geographic nodes as well as to add the search and filtering functionalities. In order to get the map displayed, I had to find a way to understand
                the features of React-Leaflet, such as the MapContainer and different component properties, and get it incorporated into the homepage of our application, which was challenging at first. </p>
            <br>
            <p>In order to develop the search and filtering functionalities, I first had to write a backend endpoint in our node router class for both destinations and routes. It worked such that when given a string representing our search term, each function
                will return a list of nodes that are related to that search term. I used Postman to test the functionality of this new endpoint in the backend. Lastly, for the frontend, I developed and incorporated 2 new search bar components that will
                make requests to the newly created endpoints and display the results. When the user clicked on a search result, they were navigated to the relevant node.

            <br>
            <p>The final solution has the following impact on its users:
                <br>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Travel Planning and Organization: </b></p>
                        <p>Users have the ability to pin destinations on a map, link notes to those destinations, and assign priorities to them, which can greatly assist them in organizing their trips. This feature allows users to visually plan their journeys,
                            making it easier to keep track of important locations and associated information.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p><b>Trip Prioritization: </b></p>
                        <p>By assigning priority levels to destinations, users can better manage their time and resources. This is particularly useful for travelers with limited time or resources who need to prioritize which destinations to visit first.
                            For example, a user may have several destinations they want to visit but can only fit a few into their schedule. With priority labels, they can easily identify which destinations are most important.</p>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Route Planning and Optimization: </b></p>
                        <p>The tool's ability to create a trail or route between pinned destinations allows users to plan their trips more efficiently. Users can visualize the best route to take, reducing travel time and ensuring they don't miss any important
                            stops along the way.</p>
                    </li>

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>Overall, this project was a great way to be exposed to various aspects of full stack development, frontend design, and UI/UX principles:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <p>
                    <li><b>UI/UX Design Principles:</b> When designing the frontend, I gained experience working with the principles of UI/UX design, such as consistency, simplicity, and responsiveness, to create a smooth and engaging user experience. This
                        was especially evident when creating the search bar, as I wanted users to have a very intuitive experience gathering results about their destinations.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>API Endpoint Design: </b>I learned the importance of clear API documentation, versioning, error handling, and designing endpoints that meet both current and future requirements.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Frontend-Backend Communication: </b> Integrating frontend and backend involves understanding how data flows between the two layers. I was able to learn about the REST communication protocol, handling asynchronous requests, and data
                        validation to ensure smooth interaction between the frontend and backend.
                    </li>
