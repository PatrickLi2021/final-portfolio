            <h2>Context and Overview:</h2>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>The Lower Providence Community Library is a public library located in Eagleville, PA, in the suburbs of Philadelphia. The goal of this project was to <b>evaluate the library's website for its accessibility, visual design, responsiveness, and usability</b>and
            <b>create a more responsive interface using HTML and CSS</b>. Another objective was to brainstorm and complete a full cycle of the design process from sketches to implementation to gain experience with the design process from start to finish.
        </p><br>

        <p>The original website had several flaws related to navigation, layout, accessibility, and user engagement. By redesigning the website, I aimed to enhance user satisfaction and make it easier for visitors to find information, access library resources,
            and engage with the community.</p>
        <br>
        <p>My role within this project was to be a frontend developer and designer.</p>
        <br>

            <h2>Research:</h2>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>I began by analyzing the existing website of the Lower Providence Community Library to identify usability problems and areas for improvement. More specifically, I used the website myself to perform various tasks, such as finding a book, creating
            an account, and looking for events. For each of these tasks, I kept track of any navigation issues, possible accessibility problems, or inconsistent language or design. In order to classify these issues in a more organized way, I divided them
            up into 4 main categories: <em>efficiency, layout/navigation, learnability,</em> and <em>memorability</em>. <br><br></p>
        <p>Here are some images of what the original library website looked like:</p>
        <div class="original-library-container">

        <p>Here is an overview of the problems I encountered while doing this initial user testing, organized by the type of problem:</p>

        <h3>Sketches:</h3>
        <br>
        <p>After doing some preliminary user testing, in order to brainstorm some alternative designs and illustrate some initial ideas, I performed <b>speed sketching</b> to experiment with several designs. The nine sketches that I created helped me think
            about many different layouts and compare attributes across them. Some attributes that I wanted to include in the final sketch were having the navigation bar stick to the top of the page, making each button the same dimensions, and including
            the upcoming events on the homepage. <br><br> Some design choices that I weighed were deciding whether or not to include a picture of the library at the top of the home screen as opposed to somewhere near the middle of the screen after the
            action buttons. In this case, the tradeoff was between creating a good initial impression and feel for the website or providing immediate functionality for the user. I came to the conclusion that putting an image right at the top would better
            convey the purpose of the website and maintain better consistency with the users' expectations in terms of branding. From this deliberation, I came to a final sketch.</p>

        <h3>Low-Fidelity Wireframing:</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Using my final sketch as a reference, I proceeded to create 3 wireframes for each screen size (mobile, tablet, and desktop). Each wireframe contained the same content and was designed in a way that made information accessible to the user in an
            intuitive way, even on smaller screens. Below, I have pictured the desktop low-fidelity wireframe, which contains the same components as the other ones.</p>
        <br>
        <div class="lofi-wireframe-container">
            <div class="desktop-wireframe-container">

            <br>
            <p>Desktop Low-Fidelity Wireframes</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <div class="tablet-wireframe-container">
                <img src="assets/tablet_lofi-1.png" alt="tablet lofi wireframe 1">

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>Tablet Low-Fidelity Wireframes</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <div class="mobile-wireframe-container">
                <img src="assets/mobile_lofi-1.png" alt="mobile lofi wireframe">
                <img src="assets/mobile_lofi-2.png" alt="mobile lofi wireframe 2">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>Mobile Low-Fidelity Wireframes</p>
            <br>
        </div>
        <p>Some key features of this design include:</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Library Name: </b>The name of the library is bolded against a light background so that users have better memorability of the title page.</p>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <p><b>Logo: </b>The logo is at the top left of the screen so that it's the first thing that users see when they load the web page.</p>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <p> <b>Navigation Menu: </b>The wireframes put the nav bar at the top of the screen, making locating the nav bar more intuitive than at the bottom. On a mobile device, the nav bar will be oriented vertically instead of horizontally.</p>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <p><b>Welcome Message: </b>The “Welcome to the Library!” title is also bolded and centered to improve memorability and create a sense of symmetry and hierarchy.</p>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <p><b>Buttons: </b>The 4 main buttons are all the same size and have enough spacing to see each line of text clearly.</p>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <p><b>Newest Book Arrivals: </b>The latest books to have arrived are more neatly organized and have a search option for users to quickly look up books.</p>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <p><b>Reading Challenges: </b>The reading challenges section has its widgets organized vertically and is not as spaced out as the original website.</p>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <p><b>Upcoming Events: </b>Instead of putting the upcoming events on a Google Calendar in one of the menu tabs, this feature can show the most imminent upcoming events that is automatically updated and then have the rest on the calendar.
                    On the mobile and tablet versions, they will be organized in a column to incorporate responsiveness.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Visual Design Style Guide:</h3>
        <br>
        <p>After making the low-fidelity wireframes, I created a visual design style guide in order to better organize the different icons, fonts, colors, and typography that would be needed for the final designs.</p>
        <br>
        <div class="style-guide">
            <img src="assets/visual_design_guide.png" alt="visual design style guide">
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>High-Fidelity Mockups:</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Next, I designed 3 high fidelity mockups that represent the final, polished look of the new website. Each of the 3 mockups is based on their low-fidelity counterparts and was created using the visual design style guide. The overall layout is shown
            below:
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

            <h2>Solution:</h2>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>Using HTML and CSS, I developed the responsive final website, ensuring compatibility with different devices and screen sizes. The website passed accessibility checks with zero errors and zero alerts, demonstrating its improved usability and accessibility.
            The final website can be found at the following link: <a href="https://patrickli2021.github.io/responsive-redesign-website/"> Lower Providence Community Library</a>. <br><br> This website greatly improves the user experience for visitors accessing
            the website from various devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones and makes various functions such as checking out a book or registering for an account much more intuitive.</p>

            <h2>Learnings and Conclusion:</h2>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>This project gave me great exposure to the iterative design process. Iterating on wireframes and mockups taught me how to identify and address usability issues effectively. Additionally, I gained a deeper understanding of the importance of accessibility
            and how to incorporate accessible features from the beginning from the beginning to create a more inclusive user experience. Lastly, I was able to practice performing responsive design using HTML and CSS. Designing for multiple devices requires
            careful consideration of layout, navigation, and content presentation, and I was able to hone my skills in those areas.</p>
