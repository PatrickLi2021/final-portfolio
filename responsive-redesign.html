            <h2>Context and Overview:</h2>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>The Lower Providence Community Library is a public library located in Eagleville, PA in the suburbs of Philadelphia. The goal of this project was to evaluate this website for its accessibility, visual design, responsiveness, and usability and
            create a more responsive interface using HTML and CSS. Another objective was to brainstorm and complete a full cycle of the design process from sketches to implementation to gain experience with the design process from start to finish.</p>

        <p>The original website had several flaws related to navigation, layout, accessibility, and user engagement. By redesigning the website, I aimed to enhance user satisfaction and make it easier for visitors to find information, access library resources,
            and engage with the community.</p>
        <br>

            <h2>Research:</h2>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>I began by analyzing the existing website of the Lower Providence Community Library to identify usability problems and areas for improvement. In order to classifty the issues in a more organized way, I divided them up into 4 main categories: <b>efficiency, layout and navigation, learnability,</b>            and <b>memorability</b>. An overview of the issues is shown below:</p>

                        <p>The user must manually click through different books to see new releases instead of searching for them.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>The user must manually click through multiple events to find the one they're looking for instead of having them display on the home screen.</p>

        <p>Here are some images of what the original library website looked like:</p>

        </div>

        <h3>Sketches:</h3>
        <br>
        <p>To brainstorm some alterantive designs and illustrate some initial ideas, I performed speed sketching to experiment with several designs. The nine sketches that I created helped me think about many different layouts and compare attributes across
            them. Some attributes that I wanted to include in the final sketch were having the navigation bar stick to hte top of the page, making each button the same dimensions, and include the upcoming events on the homepage. From this deliberation,
            I came to a final sketch as well.</p>
        <br>

        <div class="sketch-container">
            <div class="speed-sketches-container">
                <img src="assets/speed-sketches.jpg">

                <h4>Final Sketch</h4>
            </div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h3>Low-Fidelity Wireframing:</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Using my final sketch as a reference, I proceeded to create 3 wireframes for each screen size (mobile, tablet, and desktop). Each wireframe contained the same content and was designed in a way that made information accessible to the user in an
            intuitive way, even on smaller screens. Below, I have pictured the desktop low-fidelity wireframe, which contains the same components as the other ones.</p>
        <br>
        <div class="desktop-wireframe">
            <img src="assets/desktop_lofi_wireframe.png">
        </div>
        <p>Some key features of this design include:</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Library Name: </b>The name of the library is bolded against a faint background so that users have better memorability of the title page.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Logo: </b>The logo is at the top left of the screen so that it's the first thing that users see when they load the web page.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> <b>Navigation Menu: </b>The wireframes put the nav bar at the top of the screen, making locating the nav bar more intuitive than at the bottom. On a mobile device, the nav bar will be oriented vertically instead of horizontally.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Welcome Message: </b>The “Welcome to the Library!” title is also bolded and centered to improve memorability and create a sense of symmetry and hierarchy.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Buttons: </b>The 4 main buttons are all the same size and have enough spacing to see each line of text clearly.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Newest Book Arrivals: </b>The latest books to have arrived are more neatly organized and have a search option for users to quickly look up books.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Reading Challenges: </b>The reading challenges section has its widgets organized vertically and is not as spaced out as the original website.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Upcoming Events: </b>Instead of putting the upcoming events on a Google Calendar in one of the menu tabs, this feature can show the most imminent upcoming events that is automatically updated and then have the rest on the calendar.
                    On the mobile and tablet versions, they will be organized in a column to incorporate responsiveness.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Visual Design Style Guide:</h3>
        <br>
        <p>After making the low-fidelity wireframes, I created a visual design style guide in order to better organize the different icons, fonts, colors, and typography that would be needed for the final designs.</p>
        <br>
        <div class="style-guide">
            <img src="assets/visual_design_guide.png">
        </div>
        <br>
        <h3>High-Fidelity Mockups:</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Next, I designed 3 high fidelity mockups that represent the final, polished look of the new website. Each of the 3 mockups are based on their low-fidelity counterparts and were created using the visual design style guide. The overall layout is
            shown below:
        </p>
        <br>
        <div class="solution-images-container">
            <img src="assets/library-redesign.png">
            <img src="assets/library-redesign-2.png">
            <img src="assets/library-redesign-3.png">
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="solutions-container">
            <div class="colored-square"></div>
            <h2>Solution:</h2>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>Using HTML and CSS, I developed the responsive final website, ensuring compatibility with different devices and screen sizes. The website passed accessibility checks with zero errors and zero alerts, demonstrating its improved usability and accessibility.
            The final website can be found at the following link: <a href="https://patrickli2021.github.io/responsive-redesign-website/"> Lower Providence Community Library</a>.</p>

            <div class="colored-square"></div>
            <h2>Learnings and Conclusion:</h2>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>This project gave me great exposure to the iterative design process. Iterating on wireframes and mockups taught me how to identify and address usability issues effectively. Additioanlly, I gained a deeper understanding about the importance of
            accessibility and how to incorporate accessible features from the beginning from the beginning to create a more inclusive user experience. Lastly, I was able to practice performing responsive design using HTML and CSS. Designing for multiple
            devices requires careful consideration of layout, navigation, and content presentation and I was able to hone my skills in those areas.</p>
